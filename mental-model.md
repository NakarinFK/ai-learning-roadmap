# Mental Model: AI / ML / DL / GenAI

## Definitions (simplified)
- AI: systems that perform tasks requiring intelligence
- ML: systems that learn patterns from data
- DL: ML using neural networks
- GenAI: models that generate new content

## Key insight
GenAI ≠ knowledge.
It generates tokens based on probability, not understanding.

## Why this matters
If I expect truth instead of likelihood,
I will misuse LLMs and misjudge outputs.

## My takeaway
- Always treat LLM output as a draft
- Use structure and constraints to reduce error

# AI Learning Roadmap

A structured, step-by-step learning repository to build solid AI fundamentals
and practical skills — from mental models to LLM usage and small practice projects.

## Goals
- Understand AI/ML/DL/GenAI concepts clearly (no hype, no confusion)
- Build intuition about LLM behavior (tokens, context, hallucination)
- Practice with real workflows (prompting, evaluation, basic RAG thinking)
- Create a learning trail that can be referenced as a portfolio

## Repository Map
- `00-foundation/` — core mental models & basic concepts
- `01-llm-basics/` — how LLMs behave in practice
- `02-prompting/` — prompt patterns + checklists
- `03-practice/` — mini-project writeups and rubrics
- `resources/` — glossary, reading list, tools

## How to Use
1. Start with `ROADMAP.md`
2. Read one note per day (15–30 min)
3. Write your own examples at the bottom of each note
4. When ready, pick a mini-project in `03-practice/`

## Progress Tracking
- I track milestones in `ROADMAP.md`
- Notable changes go to `CHANGELOG.md`

## Conventions
- Notes are short, opinionated, and practical
- Each note ends with:
  - Key takeaways
  - Examples
  - Checklist (to self-test understanding)

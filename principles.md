# AI Learning Principles

This document defines the core principles I follow when learning,
evaluating, and applying AI systems.

These principles guide how I think, not just what tools I use.

## 1. AI is a tool, not an authority

AI outputs should never be treated as truth by default.

### Why
LLMs generate responses based on probability, not factual verification.

### Implication
- Always verify critical outputs
- Never delegate final decisions to AI alone
